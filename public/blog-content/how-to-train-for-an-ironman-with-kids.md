# How to Train for an Ironman with Kids  
  

Let me say it right from the start. My Ironman PB is 12 hours and 13 minutes. Six weeks after doing another full distance. The point is to not overshoot, communicate with your partner and be realistic with how much time you have to train and then cut that expected time in half. I only average between 5 and 8 hours of training a week. Sometimes up to 10, but that's really just peak week 2 weeks out from the race. I only swim once a week. The overhead for swimming is too much, and the swim portion is not long enough to justify much training. I did not do any endurance training before the pandemic.

This is just my personal experience. I have no idea how people doing shift work, etc. can do it.

I started out doing triathlon when we did not have kids in 2020. I did one Olympic distance and one DIY 70.3 at home just a month after that, because I wanted to push myself.

2021 we became parents to our first boy and there were no races happening, so forget about that year. All I did was about 1â€“3 accumulated hours of steady runs or bike rides per week whenever I could.

In 2022, I decided to do a middle distance, and it worked out well. I used the 80/20 Endurance 70.3 LVL0 plan. I should be capable of doing the LVL1 already, but It's just too much time. I think it's 9 workouts a week.

For 2023 I signed up for Ironman Hamburg, my first full distance triathlon. For that I purchased 80/20's Ironman LVL 0 plan. It ranges from about 6 to 13 hours per week. 2 sessions each. So you end up with 6/week.

I burned out on going to the pool two times a week, because here in Cologne it's a hit-and-miss with how many people are at the pool, so I condensed it down to one. No matter how long the session is planned to be, I'm out of the house for at least two hours.

I was working full time during that time as a web developer. I got up before six in the morning and had just one rule. "Legs up at 6:30"

I was lucky, though - My wife was staying at home for two years and both of them slept in, so I could utilize the early mornings. It was either running at 6:30, biking at 6:30 or get a head start working at 6:30 and then go to the pool later when the early birds already left, so I could be with family at 4/4:30pm.

The weekend rides and runs only really get very long towards the end of the plan, but for my first long distance, I made sure to be back by 9 or 10 in the morning on the weekends. That sometimes meant, yes, starting a ride at 5 in the morning or earlier.

One thing that I'm for sure never doing again is taking the bike on short trips. It disrupts everything. We travelled 600 km to a wedding and I had a brick workout planned the morning after the wedding. It was 5:20h bike and a 1h run. It was fun, but the hassle of bringing everything was just too much. I wouldn't recommend, and maybe just go for a 1hr run instead.

If you're in it for the long run, one missed 5hr bike ride is nothing.

Come race day, Ironman Hamburg 2023, I had to take the taper week off and go to physio. My brain spiraled into thinking my knee was messed up, when in fact I was just fatigued. I'm just one of those sedentary people whose weak hips makes their knees hurt sometimes. :-)

I finished Hamburg in 13:01h. Not what I had wished for, but I had a great time and it was one of the coolest days of my life.

4 weeks later, I signed up for Challenge Roth 2024 and Ironman Frankfurt 2024. Because why not do two of them in 6 weeks.

The training should look entirely different, because our son is now in daycare. My wife is a trauma surgeon, and her day starts before kindergarten opens. That meant becoming even smarter in when I train.

The plan was as follows:

- Mondays and Fridays off
- Tuesdays to Thursdays: Either get up at ungodly hours to train, or get up at half-ungodly hours to get a head start on work and then train once the kid is in daycare.
- Weekends, train very early or just see how it goes and communicate with my wife if it is okay to disappear for half a day.

The training for Roth started in February 2024 - I was working 32 hours a week by then. So I could manage it a little bit better. (Honestly I wouldn't know how to do this with a full-time job)

I did 8 hours of work on Mondays and Fridays and then spread the rest of the hours on the training days.

What I gained in time I also gained in setback due to viruses our son brought from daycare. In the 5 month build for Roth I lost an entire 7 weeks of training due to those. I thought about deferring my start to 2025. But nothing would change, because our son would still bring everything home.

I am nowhere near a sub 10h athlete, so it does not matter.

Don't sweat about lost training, just don't. It's a downward spiral and recovering is more important than training through it.

I finished Roth in 13:09h. Then I took two weeks off and went into another 2 weeks of "volume" and 2 weeks of taper for Frankfurt.

Frankfurt was the best performance I've ever had and I finished in 12:13h. Almost an hour faster than 6 weeks earlier.

It's possible. Yes - it's a full distance triathlon. It's hard. But it's definitely not undoable, especially when life happens. Just don't stress yourself. (coming from someone who suffers from self-induced stress almost every day)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Be realistic with training time**: I average 5-8 hours per week, occasionally up to 10.
2. **Prioritize**: I reduced swimming to once a week due to time constraints.
3. **Communicate**: Work with your partner to find suitable training times.
4. **Be flexible**: Adjust your schedule as family needs change.
5. **Start early**: Often training before 6 AM to minimize impact on family time.
6. **Don't stress about missed sessions**: Life happens, especially with kids. Recovery is more important than training through illness.
7. **It's possible**: You can complete an Ironman with limited training time. It's hard but not undoable.

Remember, if you're not aiming for a sub-10h time, don't stress too much about lost training. Focus on consistency and recovery. It's possible to train for an Ironman with kids - just be smart, communicate well, and don't put too much pressure on yourself.
